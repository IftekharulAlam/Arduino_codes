# Facial Recognition Access Control

## Overview
This project implements an advanced Facial Recognition Access Control system using Raspberry Pi and Python. The system is designed to accurately identify individuals in real-time under diverse lighting conditions.

## Features
- Robust facial recognition algorithms
- Integration with Raspberry Pi for hardware control
- Real-time image processing for seamless user experience
- Secure access control mechanisms

## Project Structure
- **`facial_recognition_access_control.py`**: Main Python script implementing the facial recognition system.
- **`components_list.txt`**: Detailed list of components used in the project.
- **`schematic.pdf`**: Schematic diagram for hardware connections.
- Install the required dependencies.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Follow the instructions in test_instructions.txt to set up and test the system.

Usage
Run the facial_recognition_access_control.py script on your Raspberry Pi.
Ensure the hardware connections are set up according to the schematic.
